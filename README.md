# AESOP BOT

This bot was developed to automate the process of finding a substitute teaching job position. The individual was having issue booking time slots as postings became available depending on when a teacher requested time off. These postings were then filled on a FCFS basis and were available for no longer than 30 minutes before being booked.

This bot scrapes the website looking for openings and when found, relays a message via email to the individual, allowing them to log onto the site to book the position.

By running this bot, the individual was able to, on average, secure 3-4 substitute positions a week in comparison to 1 substitute position without use of the bot while manually refreshing on the site ~1 hour a day.   

Note: repo has been recreated to redact private information.
